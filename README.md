# BashMaths

A collection of bash scripts for generating maths problems (suitable for ages 5-10). 

Common options:

```
 -p    print directly to the default printer (if not set, print to stdout)
 -b    (timestables only), prints a helpful numberbar.
```

Consult the individual scripts for other options.
